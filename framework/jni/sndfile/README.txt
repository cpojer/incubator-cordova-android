Compiling for Android
---------------------

CSound compiled libsndfile for android, the package is called
libsndfile-android.zip and can be downloaded here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound/files/csound5/Android/

This code here is based on libsndfile-android.
It also include libogg and libvorbis, which is needed for libsndfile.
For flac support you have to include libflac as well I guess ...

Furthermore see the following blogpost:
